# Parser Tests

Each feature of the Aether language parser should have its own test file in this directory.

- Every syntax feature in docs/syntax.md must have a dedicated test.
- Add new tests here as new features are added to the language.
- Tests should be comprehensive and cover edge cases, not just happy paths.

Example files:
- test_func.go
- test_if.go
- test_loops.go
- test_lambda.go
- test_pattern_matching.go
- ...etc.

Let's keep our parser as fresh and cheesy as a pizza straight from the oven! 🍕
